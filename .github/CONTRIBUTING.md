# Contributing to `elnora-vanta`

Thanks for your interest. This project is open to community contributions.

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Open an issue using the appropriate template:

- **Bug report** — something doesn't work, or works differently than documented
- **Feature request** — a new command, skill, or capability you'd find useful

Please search existing issues first so we can avoid duplicates.

## Pull Requests

PRs are welcome from anyone. The Elnora engineering team reviews and merges.

Before opening a PR:

1. Open an issue first if the change is non-trivial — saves you time if we'd prefer a different approach.
2. Fork the repo, create a feature branch off `main`.
3. Match the existing style (Biome enforces formatting; `pnpm lint:fix` cleans it up).
4. Add tests (Vitest) for new behavior.
5. Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) in your PR title — Release Please uses these to generate version bumps and changelog entries.
6. Run the full local check before pushing:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm lint
   pnpm typecheck
   pnpm test
   pnpm build
   node scripts/check-no-populated-references.mjs
   ```
7. Open the PR against `main`. CI runs automatically; an Elnora maintainer will review.

## A note on the read-only guarantee

The `elnora-vanta` CLI is strictly read-only: every command issues HTTP GET
requests only, enforced in the client code, in tests, and by a PreToolUse hook.
PRs that add write operations (POST/PATCH/DELETE) against the Vanta API will be
declined — it's a design constraint, not an oversight.
